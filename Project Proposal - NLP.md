# NLP Project Proposal

Andrew Wong

For my project I intend to use a dataset of US Amazon reviews with the Video Games category. The dataset appears to have 1.7+ million datapoints/documents, which includes the review text body and the review star rating.

I plan to use topic modeling to find the top topics among video game reviews. I am also thinking about finding the more pertinent topics for each star rating. The business application of this could benefit game developers by providing insight into the topics/areas that correlate to positive reviews, as well as the topics that correlate to negative reviews.

Feedback on additional directions or layers are appreciated!
